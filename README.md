This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Objektify â€“ Visual shopping from any image

Upload a photo (even AI-generated), draw a box around the object you want, and get product results from the web to buy the item or similar ones.

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Set environment variables (create a `.env.local`):

```
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
```

You can get a key from Azure Cognitive Services (Bing Visual Search) in the Azure Portal.

3. Run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 and upload an image. Drag to select the object and click "Search products".

### Notes

- The API route `src/app/api/visual-search/route.ts` posts the image bytes to Bing Visual Search and simplifies results to a small item list.
- Remote images from major CDNs are allowed via `next.config.ts`.
- If Bing returns no shopping sources, the UI falls back to visually similar items.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
